# Final-Pipelines---VERSION-2.0
This has all the pipelines that have been finalised
So far the list has the following pipelines
  1. Stephanie Schuller pipeline - DADA2 and Phyloseq with Shannon Diversity Index - gives abundance plots and Shannon Diversity from Fastq files.
  2. May2022_Script_OppositeResults - DADA2, Phyloseq, PCoA with Manhattan Distances, K-Means Clustering, and Wilcoxon Tests. No read filtering was done with this but I might do it for the next one. It gives the same result       as before when repeated.
